# DataCentricAICompetition

This repository will contain code/data/results/discussions for my take on the "Data-Centric AI Competition" (https://https-deeplearning-ai.github.io/data-centric-comp/?utm_source=thebatch&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=dc-ai-competition&utm_content=dl-ai) organized by DeepLearning.AI and Landing AI.

All notebooks are designed to be run on Google Colab, but can be modified readily to run in other envs.
